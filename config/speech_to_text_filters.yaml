# This file is used to filter out specific phrases from auto generated speech to text output.
# Add one phrase per line, as either a string or regular expression.
# All exact matches to the provided string or regular expressions are removed from the .txt and .vtt file.
# Regular expressions require `!ruby/regexp` in front of the expression as shown in the examples below.
# Be cautious when using regular expressions as they can be very powerful and may remove more than intended.
# Using start/end line anchors (^ and $) in regular expressions may be wise in some cases.
# You can test your regular expressions to see if they work as expected at https://rubular.com/
