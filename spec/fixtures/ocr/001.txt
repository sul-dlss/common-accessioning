LEAVES OF GRASS.

EIDOLONS.
I mer a seer,
Passing the hues and objects of the world,
The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,
To glean eidélons.

Put in thy chants said he, ;
No more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put 1n,
Put first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,
That of eiddlons.

Ever the dim beginning,
Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle, :
Ever the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)
Fidélons ! eidélons !

Ever the mutable,
Ever materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,
Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,

Issuing eidélons.

Lo, I or you,

Or woman, man, oF state, known or unknown,

We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,
But really build eidélons.

‘The ostent evanescent,
“The substance of an artist’s mood or savan’s studies long,
Or warrior’s, martyr’s, hero’s toils,

To fashion his eiddlon.

Of every human life,
(The units gather'd, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)
‘The whole or large or small summ’d, added up,

In its eiddlon.

The old, old urge,
Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,
From science and the modern still impell’d,

The old, old urge, eiddlons.

‘The present now and here,
America’s busy, teeming, intricate whirl
Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,
"To-day’s ciddlons.
